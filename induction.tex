\title{Induced Representations}
\author{Alexander Duncan}

\maketitle

{\bf
Throughout this document, we make the standing assumptions that $G$
is a finite group and $k$ is a field of characteristic coprime to the
order of $G$.}

``The basics'' of induced representations can be found in essentially
every introductory character theory text.  For example:
\cite[\S{16}]{AlperinBell},
\cite[\S{5.8-5.11}]{Etingof},
\cite[\S{3.3}]{FultonHarris},
\cite[\S{XVIII.6--9}]{Lang}, or
\cite[\S{3.3}]{Serre}.
However, we go a bit further then ``the basics'' here;
see \cite[\S{7--10}]{Serre}.

\section{Group Actions}

Let $G$ be a group.

\begin{definition}
A (left) \emph{$G$-set} is a set $X$ with a (left) action of a finite
group $G$.  Given $G$-sets $X$ and $Y$, a \emph{morphism of $G$-sets}
or \emph{$G$-equivariant map} is a function $f : X \to Y$
such that $f(gx)=gf(x)$ for all $x \in X$ and $g \in G$.
An \emph{isomorphism of $G$-sets} is a $G$-equivariant bijection. 
\end{definition}

Let $H$ be a subgroup $H$ of $G$.  Recall that a \emph{left coset} is a
subset of $G$ of the form
\[
gH = \{ gh \mid h \in H \}
\]
for some $g \in G$.  Recall that the left cosets partition $G$.
We denote by $G/H$ the set of left cosets of $H$ in $G$.
We do \emph{not} expect $G/H$ to have a group structure unless $H$ is
normal.

\begin{proposition}
The set $G/H$ has a canonical transitive left $G$-action.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The action is defined via
\[
g \cdot (aH) := (ga)H
\]
for $g,a \in G$.
Suppose $aH=bH$ for $a,b \in G$.  Then $a=bh$ for some $h \in H$.
Thus $ga=gbh$ for all $g \in G$.  Thus $gaH=gbH$.
We conclude that the action is well-defined.
Checking the remaining two axioms for a group action are left as an exercise.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
The definition of the left action on $G/H$ is more subtle than the proof
suggests.  We do \emph{not} have an analogous right action on $G/H$
since it is not well-defined.  Asking that the right action be
well-defined is equivalent to asking that $H$ be a normal subgroup.
\end{remark}

\begin{exercise}
Let $H,K$ be subgroups of $G$.
The $G$-sets $G/H$ and $G/K$ are isomorphic if and only if
$H$ and $K$ are conjugate subgroups of $G$.
\end{exercise}

Recall that a $G$-set $X$ is \emph{transitive} if $X$ is nonempty
and, for all $x \in X$ and
$y \in Y$, there exists a $g \in G$ such that $gx=y$.

\begin{exercise}
Every $G$-set can be written uniquely as a disjoint union of
transitive $G$-sets.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proposition}
Every non-empty transitive $G$-set $X$ is isomorphic to $G/H$
for some subgroup $H \subseteq G$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Since $X$ is non-empty, we may select some $x \in X$.
Let $H$ be the stabilizer of $x$ in $G$:
\[
H = \operatorname{Stab}_G(x) = \{ g \in G \mid gx=x \}.
\]
We claim there is a unique $G$-equivariant function
$f : X \to G/H$ such that $f(x)=H$.
Indeed, since $G$ acts transitively on $X$,
the condition $f(gx)=gf(x)$ determines the value of $f$ at every point
of $X$.  To see that this is well-defined, we simply observe that
$f(gx)=f(g'x)$ is equivalent to $g^{-1}g'x=x$, which is equivalent to
$g^{-1}g' \in H$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Right actions}

Everything stated above for \emph{left} group actions has a natural
generalization to \emph{right} group actions, which we mostly leave as
an exercise for the reader.
We use the notation $H \backslash G$ for the set of right cosets of $H$
in $G$.

The following exercises are strongly recommended if you haven't
though about the distinction of left and right actions before:

\begin{exercise}
If $X$ is a \emph{left} $G$-set and $G$ is abelian, then there is a
\emph{right} action on $X$ via $x \cdot g := gx$ for $g \in G$ and $x \in X$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
If $X$ is a \emph{left} $G$-set, then we obtain a \emph{right}
action on $X$ via $x \cdot g := g^{-1}x$ for $g \in G$ and $x \in X$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
The function $f : G/H \to H\backslash G$ given by $f(gH)=Hg$ is a
well-defined bijection if and only if $H$ is normal in $G$.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Double cosets}

Let $H, K$ be subgroups of $G$.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{(H,K)-double coset of G} is a set of the form
\[
HgK := \{ hgk \mid h \in H, k \in K \}
\]
for some $g \in G$.
The set of double cosets of $G$ is denoted
$H \backslash G / K$.
\end{definition}

There are several different equivalent perspectives on double cosets.
Double cosets are the equivalence classes for the equivalence relation
$g \sim hgk$ for $h \in H$ and $k \in K$.
Double cosets are the orbits of the left $H$-action on $G/K$.
Double cosets are the orbits of the right $K$-action on $H\backslash G$.
Finally, double cosets are the orbits of the \emph{left} action
of $H \times K$ on $G$ via $(h,k)\cdot g := hgk^{-1}$.

Each of these perspectives is useful in different contexts.
An immediate consequence is that double cosets partition $G$;
in other words, $HgK$ and $Hg'K$ are either disjoint or equal
and every element of $G$ is contained in some double coset.
Another consequence is that each double coset is both a union of
right cosets of $H$ in $G$ and a union of left cosets of $K$ in $G$.

Note that unlike ordinary cosets, double cosets are not guaranteed to
all have the same size.  However, their size can be easily computed
from the orbit stabilizer theorem:

\begin{exercise}
If $G$ is finite, then
\[
|HgK| = \frac{|H| |K|}{|H \cap g K g^{-1}|}=
\frac{|H| |K|}{|g^{-1}Hg \cap K|}.
\]
\end{exercise}

\section{Introduction}

Let $H$ be a subgroup of a finite group $G$.

Given a representation $(V,\rho)$ of $G$, we define the \emph{restriction to
$H$} as the representation $(V,\rho|_H)$ where the underlying vector
space is the same, but the group homomorphism $\rho|_H : H \to
\operatorname{GL}(V)$ is obtained from $H$.
We write $\operatorname{Res}_H^G(V)$ or $V {\downarrow}^G_H$
even though the vector space is the same.

Induced representations are a method of going in the other direction.
We begin with a representation of $H$ and produce a representation of
$G$.
It is convenient to define induced representations via their universal
property:

\begin{definition}
Let $W$ be a representation of $H$ and suppose $H$ is a subgroup of a
finite group $G$.
The \emph{induced representation} is a representation
$\operatorname{Ind}_H^G W$ of $G$ along with an
$H$-equivariant map $\iota : W \to \operatorname{Ind}_H^G W$ such that
for any other representation $V$ of $G$ and $H$-equivariant map
$\varphi : W \to V$, there exists a unique $G$-equivariant map
$\psi: \operatorname{Ind}_H^G W \to V$ such that
$\psi = \phi \circ \iota$.
\end{definition}

An alternative notation for $\operatorname{Ind}_H^G W$ is $W
{\uparrow}_H^G$.

As usual, the universal property is economical to state and is useful
theoretically, but it is less easy to see that it exists.
On the other hand, any explicit construction will have various
unimportant ``implementation details'' that vary from author to author
and are not of fundamental importance.
Nevertheless, a direct construction must be carried out:

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:ind_construction}
Induced representations exist and are unique up to unique isomorphism.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The uniqueness statement follows from the universal mapping property by
abstract nonsense.  The interesting part is existence.

We are given a finite group $G$ with subgroup $H$ and a representation
$(W,\sigma)$ of $H$.
Choose a system of distinct representatives $X$ for $G/H$.
Let $V$ be the direct sum $\bigoplus_{x \in X} W$.
Labeling the $x$th summand of $V$ by $xW$,
we obtain isomorphisms $\phi_x : W \to xW$.

Fix $g \in G$; we will define a map
$\rho_g \in \operatorname{End}_k(V)$ by defining its action on each $xW$
and extending by linearity.
For every $x \in X$, there is a unique $y \in X$ and $h \in H$
such that $gx=yh$.  For $w \in xW$, we define
$\rho_g|_{xW}=\phi_y \circ \sigma_h \circ \phi_x^{-1}$
as an element of $\operatorname{Hom}_k(xW,yW)$.

It is now tedious, but straightforward, to check that $(V,\rho)$ is linear
representation of $G$ satisfying the desired universal property.
\end{proof}

In practice, many representations are induced from a subgroups.  We've
already seen many examples.  In particular:

\begin{proposition}
If $V$ is a permutation representation of a finite group $G$,
then $V$ is a direct sum of representations induced from the trivial
representation of subgroup.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Recall that $V$ has a basis $\{e_x\}_{x \in X}$ where $X$ is a $G$-set.
Since all $G$-sets are a disjoint union of transitive $G$-sets,
we see that $V$ is a direct sum of permutation representations
corresponding to transitive $G$-sets.  Thus, without loss of generality
we may assume $X \cong G/H$ for some subgroup $H \subseteq G$.

Choosing a system of distinct representatives $S$ for $G/H$,
we now identify the direct summands $sW$ in the proof of
Proposition~\ref{prop:ind_construction} with the spans of
the basis elements $\{ e_{sH} \}$ in $V$.
One checks that the group action of $G$ is identical in both cases.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
A representation $(V,\rho)$ of a group $G$ is a\emph{monomial
representation} or a \emph{twisted permutation representation} if 
there exists a basis $\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$ of $V$
such that, for all $1 \le i \le n$ and $g \in G$, there exists
a $1 \le j \le n$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}^\times$ such that
$\rho_g(e_i)=\lambda e_j$.
\end{definition}

Informally, monomial representations are those whose matrices have
exactly one non-zero element in each row and column.
Permutation representations are those where that non-zero element is
always equal to one.

\begin{exercise}
If $V$ is a monomial representation of a finite group $G$,
then $V$ is a direct sum of representations induced from one-dimensional
representations of subgroups.
\end{exercise}

\section{Examples}

\subsection{Example of Non-Induced Representation}

The following may seem rather technical at the moment, but it will be
relevant later in the course.  We introduce it now so that we have a
non-abelian example of a irreducible representation that is
\emph{not} an induced representation.

Recall that \emph{Hamilton's quaternion algebra} $\mathbb{H}$
is the division $\mathbb{R}$-algebra
with basis $\{1,i,j,k\}$ and multiplication determined by
$ij=k$, $jk=i$, $ki=j$ and $i^2=j^2=k^2=-1$.
We have an embedding
$\mathbb{H} \hookrightarrow \operatorname{M}_2(\mathbb{C})$
by extending
\[
1 \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 1&0\\0&1 \end{pmatrix} \quad
i \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} i&0\\0&-i \end{pmatrix} \quad
j \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0&1\\-1&0 \end{pmatrix} \quad
k \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0&i\\i&0 \end{pmatrix}
\]
by linearity.
This embedding is a homomorphism of $\mathbb{R}$-algebras.
(Note that there is no embedding of $\mathbb{H}$ into
the \emph{real} $2\times 2$ matrices.)

A general element $x$ of $\mathbb{H}$ of the form
\[
x = a + bi + cj + dk
\]
where $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{R}$.
We define the \emph{conjugate} of $x$ as
\[
\overline{x} = a -bi-cj-dk,
\]
and the \emph{norm} of $x$ as
\[
\|x\| = \sqrt{\overline{x} x} = \sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2},
\]
which is a non-negative real number.
We see that $\mathbb{H}$ is a division algebra
since $x^{-1} = \overline{x}/\|x\|$ is an explicit formula for the
inverse when $x \ne 0$.

A general element $x$ of $\mathbb{H}$
is a \emph{Lipschitz quaternion} if
$a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Z}$.
The element $x$ is a \emph{Hurwitz quaternion}
if either $a,b,c,d$ are all integers, or all half-integers.
The set $L$ of Lipschitz quaternions and the set $H$ of Hurwitz
quaternions are both subrings of Hamilton's quaternions.
The unit groups for these rings can be found by observing that the norm of
an invertible element must be $1$.

The \emph{quaternionic group} $Q_8 = \{\pm 1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\}$ is
the unit group $U(L)$ of the ring $L$.
It is evident from the embedding
$\mathbb{H} \to \operatorname{M}_2(\mathbb{C})$ described above
that $Q_8$ has a representation by ``twisted permutation
matrices.''
Namely, there is a choice of basis where the group acts by permuting
the basis elements and multiplying them by scalars.

The unit group $U(H)$ of the ring $H$ contains $Q_8$ and the 16 elements
\[
\frac{ \pm 1 \pm i \pm j \pm k }{2}
\]
where all possible sign combinations are permitted.
One checks that $\frac{1}{2}(1+i+j+k)$ has order $6$, and thus we have a
representation with image
\[
\left\langle \begin{pmatrix} i&0\\0&-i \end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix} 0&1\\-1&0 \end{pmatrix},
\frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1+i&1+i\\-1+i&1-i \end{pmatrix}\right\rangle
.
\]
This is a representation that \emph{cannot} be written wholly with
``twisted permutation matrices'' in any basis.

The group $U(H)$ is sometimes called the ``binary tetrahedral group''
due to the following description.

\begin{exercise}
Let $Z$ be the center of $U(H)$.
Prove that the center $Z$ of $U(H)$ has order $2$ and
$U(H)/Z $ is isomorphic to $A_4$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Prove that $U(H)$ is isomorphic to $Q_8 \rtimes (\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z})$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Prove that $U(H)$ is isomorphic to the special linear group
$\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_3)$ over the field of $3$ elements.
\end{exercise}
