\title{Representations over non-closed fields}
\author{Alexander Duncan}

\maketitle

Throughout, $k$ is a field of characteristic $0$
and $\overline{k}$ is the algebraic closure of $k$.
(For those uncomfortable with infinite Galois extensions,
one can instead replace $\overline{k}$ with the Galois closure
of the finitely many relevant finite field extensions
showing up in any of the contexts we discuss below.)

Much of this is inspired from \cite[\S{12--13}]{Serre}.

\section{Representation Ring via Modules}

Let $G$ be a finite group.

Recall that $kG$ is the group algebra of $G$ over $k$.
Since $k$ has characterstic $0$, we know $kG$ is semisimple.
We have a canonical decomposition
\[
kG \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^r A_i
\]
where $A_1,\ldots,A_r$ are simple $k$-algebras.

Each $A_i$ is a central simple $F_i$-algebra
for a finite field extension $F_i/k$.
Let $n_i = \deg(A_i)$ be the \emph{degree} of $A_i$.
Equivalently, we have $n_i^2 = \dim_{F_i}(A_i)$
or
\[
A_i \otimes_{F_i} \overline{k} \cong
\operatorname{M}_{n_i}(\overline{k})
\]
as $\overline{k}$-algebras.

More precisely, there exists a central division $F_i$-algebra $D_i$
and a positive integer $m_i$ such that
\[
A_i \cong \operatorname{M}_{m_i}(D_i)
\]
as $F_i$-algebras.
Both $m_i$ and the isomorphism class of $D_i$ are uniquely determined.
Let $d_i := \operatorname{ind}(A_i)$ denote the Schur index of $A_i$.
We have $d_i = \deg(D_i)$, which is equivalent to
$d_i^2=\dim_{F_i}(D_i)$.  Also, we have $n_i=m_id_i$.

Each $A_i$ has a simple module $V_i$, which is unique up to isomorphism.
Since $V_i \cong D_i^{\oplus n_i}$, we see that
\[
\dim_k V_i = [F_i:k]m_id_i^2 = [F_i:k]d_in_i .
\]
The vector spaces $V_1,\ldots,V_r$ are precisely the
irreducible representations of $G$ over $k$.
The \emph{Schur index} of $V_i$ is defined to be the
Schur index $d_i$ of the associated algebra $A_i$.

Let $\Gamma$ be the absolute Galois group
$\operatorname{Gal}(\overline{k}/k$.
Let $X_i :=
\operatorname{Hom}_{k-\operatorname{alg}}(F_i,\overline{k})$.
Observe that $X_i$ has a left action of $\Gamma$ by
post-composition.
Informally, $X_i$ can be thought of as the set of roots of the minimal
polynomial of a primitive element of $F_i/k$.
We have a $\overline{k}$-algebra isomorphism
\[
\omega : F_i \otimes_k \overline{k} \cong
\bigoplus_{\sigma \in X_i} \overline{k}
\]
via $\omega(f \otimes \ell)_{\sigma} := \sigma(f)\ell$.

For each $\sigma \in X_i$, we may define a tensor product
$A_i \otimes_\sigma \overline{k}$ of $F_i$-algebras
where we use the structure map $F_i \to A_i$ on the left and
the homomorphism $\sigma : F_i \to \overline{k}$ on the right.
Via the sequence of isomorphisms of $\overline{k}$-algebras
\[
A_i \otimes_k \overline{k} \cong 
A_i \otimes_{F_i} F_i \otimes_k \overline{k}
\cong A_i \otimes_{F_i} \bigoplus_{\sigma \in X_i} \overline{k}
\]
we obtain an isomorphism
\[
\Omega : A_i \otimes_k \overline{k} \cong
\bigoplus_{\sigma \in X_i} A_i \otimes_\sigma \overline{k} .
\]

Let $W_{i,\sigma}$ be the irreducible representation
of $\overline{k}G$ corresponding to $A_i \otimes_\sigma \overline{k}$.
We conclude that we have the following decomposition
\[
V_i \otimes_k \overline{k} \cong
\bigoplus_{\sigma \in X_i} W_{i,\sigma}^{\oplus d_i}
\]
for each irreducible representation $V_i$ of $kG$.

If $\rho_{i,\sigma} : G \to \operatorname{GL}(W_{i,\sigma})$ are
the corresponding maps, then notice that
\[
\tau \circ \rho_{i,\sigma} = \rho_{i,\tau(\sigma)}
\]
for every $\tau \in \Gamma$.
Thus, there is a left action of $\Gamma$ on the set of irreducible
representations of $G$ over $\overline{k}$
with orbits corresponding to the $\Gamma$-sets $X_i$.

\section{Character Theory}

Here we will assume that $\overline{k}$ (and therefore $k$)
is a specific subfield of $\mathbb{C}$.
This is essentially harmless in view of the Lefschetz principle.
For the suspicious, assume that $\mathbb{C}$ is just bizarre notation for
$\overline{k}$ throughout the remainder of the document.

Recall that the representation ring $R_k(G)$ of $G$ over $k$
is the additive group of virtual representations over $k$
with multiplication obtained extending the tensor product
on the subrig $R_k^+(G)$.
From above, we see that $R_k(G)$ is a free abelian group
on the set $[V_1],\ldots,[V_r]$.

The map $[V] \mapsto [V \otimes_k \overline{k}]$
gives a canonical injective ring homomorphism
\[
R_k(G) \hookrightarrow R_{\mathbb{C}} = R(G)
\]
and therefore a canonical injective ring homomorphism
\[
R_k(G) \hookrightarrow C(G)
\]
where $C(G)$ is the set of complex class functions on $G$.

Just as in the complex case, given a representation $(V,\rho)$
of $G$ over $k$, we define the character
$\chi_V : G \to k$
via the trace $\chi_V(g) := \operatorname{tr}(\rho(g))$.
This agrees with the map $R_k(G) \hookrightarrow C(G)$ defined above.
Thus, we identify $R_k(G)$ with a subring of $R(G)$ and $C(G)$ in what
follows.

Let $\chi_1,\ldots,\chi_r$ be the irreducible representations of $G$
over $k$ corresponding to the algebras $A_1,\ldots, A_r$ above.
Let $\psi_{i,\sigma} : G \to \overline{k}=\mathbb{C}$ be the character
corresponding to the irreducible representation $W_{i,\sigma}$
defined in the previous section.

\begin{theorem}
For every $1 \le i \le r$, we have
\[
\chi_i = d_i \sum_{\sigma \in X_i} \psi_{i,\sigma} .
\]
In particular, the characters $\chi_1,\ldots, \chi_r$
are an orthogonal basis for the subspace $R_k(G)$ of $C(G)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The description of $\chi_i$ follows from the results in the previous
section.
The orthogonality follows from the fact that the $\psi_{i,\sigma}$
are orthogonal.
\end{proof}

Note that we only have the $\{\chi_1,\ldots,\chi_r\}$ is an
\emph{orthogonal} basis; it is not necessarily orthonormal.

There are in fact \emph{three} different traces that one may consider
for each irreducible representation $V_i$.
We have the ordinary trace $\chi_i(g) \in k$ as an element of
$\operatorname{End}_k(V_i)$.
We may also define $\phi_i(g) \in F_i$ as the trace of $g$ in
$\operatorname{End}_{F_i}(V_i)$.
Finally, we have $\psi_i(g) \in F_i$ as the reduced trace
$\operatorname{Trd}(g)$ viewing $g$ as an element of the central simple
$F_i$-algebra $A_i$.
These traces are all related via
\[
\chi_i = \operatorname{Tr}_{F_i/k} \circ \phi_i, \quad
\phi_i = d_i \psi_i
\]
where we recall that $d_i$ is the Schur index of the central simple
$F_i$-algebra $A_i$ (equivalently, the representation $V_i$).
Finally for each $\sigma \in X_i$, we see that $\psi_{i,\sigma} = \sigma
\circ \psi_i$.
This gives another way of obtaining the decomposition of $V_i \otimes_k
\overline{k}$ above.

\subsection{Definability of Representations}

Recall, from the previous section, that the absolute Galois group
permutes the irreducible representations of $\overline{k}G$.
Indeed, if $\rho_{i,\sigma} : G \to \operatorname{GL}(W_{i,\sigma})$
is the map then we have
\[
\tau \circ \rho_{i,\sigma} = \rho_{i,\tau(\sigma)}
\]
for $\tau \in \Gamma$.
This action is identical to the one obtained by acting on the
characters
\[
\tau \circ \phi_{i,\sigma} = \phi_{i,\tau(\sigma)}
\]
where we recall $\phi_{i,\sigma}: G \to \overline{k}$ is just a
particular class function.

\begin{theorem}
Let $\overline{R}_k(G)$ be the subset of $R(G)$ consisting of characters
whose class functions whose image is defined over $k$.
Then $\overline{R}_k(G)$ has basis
\[
\frac{\chi_1}{d_1},
\frac{\chi_2}{d_2},
\cdots,
\frac{\chi_r}{d_r}.
\]
\end{theorem}

Thus $\overline{R}_k(G)$ can be completely recovered from the character
table over $\mathbb{C}$.  Namely, one can reconstruct the $\chi_i/d_i$
as the sums of $\Gamma$-orbits of the complex characters.
To reconstruct $\overline{R}_k(G)$, one needs to know the Schur indices.

\begin{proposition}
If $G$ is an abelian group,
then $R_k(G) = \overline{R}_k(G)$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
If $G$ is abelian, then $kG$ is commutative, so all constituent
division algebras are fields.  Thus all Schur indices are trivial.
\end{proof}

We are now in a position to prove an important theorem of Brauer, which
essentially reduces the study of definability of representations of
arbitrary fields of characteristic $0$ to the case of cyclotomic fields.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:define_over_cyclotomic}
If $G$ is a finite group of exponent $e$,
then every representation of $G$ over an arbitrary field of
characteristic $0$
is conjugate to a representation defined over the
cyclotomic field $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_e)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $K=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_e)$.  We want to show that $R_K(G)=R(G)$.
By Brauer's theorem, we may write a general element $\chi$ of $R(G)$
in the form
\[
\rho = \sum_{i=1}^m c_i\operatorname{Ind}_{H_i}^G(\tau_i)
\]
where the $c_i$'s are integers, the $H_i$ are subgroups of $G$,
and each $\tau_i$ is a one-dimensional representations of $R(H_i)$.
A one-dimensional representation of $H_i$ is defined over
$\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_e)$ since $H_i$ has exponent at most $e$.
We conclude that $\chi$ is an integral linear combination of
representations induced from $R_K(H_i)$, so is in $R_K(G)$ as desired.
\end{proof}

\section{Column Orthogonality}

We saw above that $\chi_1,\ldots,\chi_r$ are an orthogonal basis for
$R_k(G)$.  This amounts to showing that the \emph{rows} of the character
table of $G$ (over $k$) are orthogonal.
However, we now have ``too many'' columns if we expect a square
character table.
Here we investigate this issue.

For each positive integer $n$, define the \emph{Adams operation}
$\Psi^n : C(G) \to C(G)$ as the function that takes
a class function $\chi$ to the class function $\Psi^n(\chi)$ defined by
\[
\Psi^n(\chi)(g) := \chi(g^n)
\]
for each $g \in G$.

\begin{proposition}
Every Adams operation restricts to a ring homomorphism
from $R_k(G)$ to itself.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $\chi$ be the character of a representation $(V,\rho)$.
For a given $g$, consider the multiset of eigenvalues
\[
a_1,\ldots, a_m
\]
of $\rho(g)$.
Thus $\chi(g)=p_1$ where $p_1$ is the first power sum polynomial
in $a_1,\ldots, a_m$.
We have $\chi(g^n)=p_n$ where $p_n$ is the power sum polynomial
\[
a_1^n + \cdots + a_m^n.
\]
By the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, there exists a
polynomial $f_n$ with integer coefficients such that
\[
p_n = f_n(e_1,\ldots,e_m)
\]
where $e_1,\ldots,e_m$ are the elementary symmetric polynomials
in $a_1,\ldots,a_n$.

The function $f_n$ does not depend on the eigenvalues, so we have an
expression
\[
\Psi^n(\chi) = f_n(\Lambda^1 \chi, \ldots, \Lambda^n \chi)
\]
in the ring $C(G)$. Since exterior powers of a representation are
representations, we see that $\Psi^n(\chi)$ is in $R_k(G)$ as desired.
\end{proof}

Recall that the \emph{exponent} $e$ of a finite group is the least common multiple
of the orders of all the elements $g \in G$.
Equivalently, the exponent $e$ is the least positive integer such that
$g^e=1$ for all $g \in G$.

\begin{lemma}
If $n$ is relatively prime to $e$,
then the function $g \mapsto g^t$ is a bijection from $G$ to itself,
which takes conjugacy classes to conjugacy classes.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $s$ be the multiplicative inverse of $n$ modulo $e$,
which exists since $t$ is relatively prime to $e$.
The function $g \mapsto g^s$ is the inverse function to
$g \mapsto g^t$ since $g^{ts}=g^1=g$.
\end{proof}

From this we immediately conclude:

\begin{corollary}
If $t$ is relatively prime to $e$,
then $\Psi^t : R(G) \to R(G)$ is an isomorphism.
\end{corollary}

Thus, for appropriate $t$, the Adams operations $\Psi^t$
permute the \emph{columns} of the character table of $R(G)$.

In view of Theorem~\ref{thm:define_over_cyclotomic},
we may assume that $k \subseteq K=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_e)$
where $e$ is the exponent of $G$.
Let $\Gamma$ be the Galois group of $K/k$.
Observe that $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of
$(\mathbb{Z}/e\mathbb{Z})^\times$.
Let $\Gamma$ be generated by $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_s$
where $\sigma(\zeta_e)=\zeta_e^t$ for some $t_1,\ldots,t_s$ in
$(\mathbb{Z}/e\mathbb{Z})^\times$.

We now have two actions of $\Gamma$ on $R(G)$.
Given $\gamma \in \Gamma$ and $\chi \in R(G)$, we have
\[
(\gamma \ast \chi)(g) := \gamma(\chi(g)) 
\]
for all $g \in G$,
where we view $\chi: G \to K$ as a function with codomain $K \subset
\overline{k}$.
We also have the action using the Adams operation
which is generated by
\[
\sigma_i \ast' \chi := \Psi^{t_i}(\chi)
\]
for $1 \le i \le s$.

\begin{proposition}
The two actions of $\Gamma$ on $R(G)$ coincide.
\end{proposition} 

\begin{proof}
The eigenvalues of every matrix $M$ in every representation of $G$ is an
$e$th root of unity.
Thus, if $\chi$ is a character in $R(G)$, then
\[
(\sigma_i \circ \chi)(g) = \Psi^{t_i}(\chi)(g)
\] 
for every $\sigma \in \Gamma$.
\end{proof}

In view of the above, we define the \emph{$\Gamma$-classes}
(or \emph{$K$-classes}) of $G$ to be the unions of $\Gamma$-orbits of
conjugacy classes.
We therefore have:

\begin{theorem}
$\overline{R}_k(G)$ is precisely the subset of $R(G)$ whose corresponding
characters are fixed by the $\Gamma$-action.
\end{theorem}

As an immediate corollary, we obtain:

\begin{corollary}
The number of irreducible characters of $G$ over $k$
is equal to the number of $\Gamma$-classes of $G$.
\end{corollary}

Observe that the $\Gamma$-classes of $G$ are totally group-theoretic.
We don't actually need to compute the character table to determine the
number of irreducible representations (just like over $\mathbb{C}$).

However, we only obtain $\overline{R}_k(G)$ from this analysis.
More work needs to be done to identify the Schur indices.
