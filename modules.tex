\title{Modules and Wedderburn Theory}
\author{Alexander Duncan}

\maketitle

Modern representation theory is usually phrased in the language of
non-commutative rings/algebras and their modules.
Until now I've avoided this language so I could focus on the basics.
However, the module-theoretic perspective is much more versatile --- even
for finite groups over $\mathbb{C}$.
It is much more urgently needed to discuss representation
theory over other fields. 

The main object is the \emph{group ring} $\mathbb{Z}G$
or \emph{group algebra} $kG$.  We will see that most of the language of
representation theory of finite groups can be efficiently expressed
as special cases of module theory over $kG$.
Then we will use the language to go even further.

Since module theory is part of the standard algebra qual sequence,
I will frequently omit proofs and even many definitions under the
assumption that you should have seen them before.
However, the emphasis in qual courses is usually on
\emph{commutative} rings so some reminders are in order.
I recommend finding a graduate algebra textbook with a good treatment of
modules, such as \cite[\S{10}]{DF} or \cite[\S{III}]{Lang},
to refer to if something is unfamiliar.

The ``basics'' of module-theoretic representation theory is in
almost every text I've referenced, often at a very early stage; 
see \cite{DF}, \cite{Etingof}, \cite{FultonHarris}, \cite{Lang} etc.
Serre's book \cite{Serre}, does not use the module-theoretic
perspective at first, but then abruptly changes gears in chapter 6 and
assumes you've seen Wedderburn theory (developed below).
I will also draw heavily from \cite[\S{12,13}]{AlperinBell},
\cite{AlperinLRT}, and \cite{CurtisReiner}.

\section{The Group Ring}

Throughout, we assume that all rings and algebras are unital (have an identity
element) but are \emph{not necessarily} commutative.

\begin{definition}
Suppose $G$ is a finite group.
The \emph{group ring} $\mathbb{Z}G$ is the free abelian group
on $G$ with multiplication given by
\[
\left( \sum_{g \in G} a_g g \right) \cdot
\left( \sum_{g \in G} b_g g \right)
:= \sum_{g \in G} \sum_{h \in G} a_gb_h gh
\]
for integers $\{a_g\}_{g\in G}$ and $\{b_g\}_{g\in G}$.
More generally, given a commutative ring $k$,
the \emph{group algebra} $kG$ is the free $k$-module on $G$
with multiplication as above.
\end{definition}

One checks immediately that $\mathbb{Z}G$ is a non-commutative ring with
identity $1$ corresponding to the basis element of the identity in $G$.
Similarly, $kG$ is a $k$-algebra with identity $1$.
Since $1 \in G$ corresponds to $1 \in \mathbb{Z}G$,
the identification of the basis of $\mathbb{Z}G$ with the elements of
$G$ is mostly harmless if $G$ is written multiplicatively.

\begin{example}
Suppose $G=D_6=\langle s,r \mid s^2, r^3, (sr)^2 \rangle$
is the dihedral group of order $6$.
We have the following computation in $\mathbb{Z}G$:
\begin{align*}
&(3 + 2s + 5r)(r-sr + 5r^2)\\
=& 3r -3sr +15r^2 + 2sr -2r+10sr^2 +5r^2 -5s+25\\
=& 25 -5s + r + 20r^2 -sr +10sr^2
\end{align*}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $G = \langle r \mid r^n \rangle$ be a cyclic group of order $n$.
Thus $G$ has basis $\{1,r,r^2,\ldots, r^{n-1} \}$
where $r^i\cdot r^j=r^{i+j}$ subject to the relation $r^n=1$.
In other words, $\mathbb{Z}G$ is isomorphic to the ring
$\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^n-1)$.
\end{example}

Note that using additive notation $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$
for the cyclic group of order $n$ would be dangerously
ambiguous in the example above.
For this reason, we usually use ``exponential notation''
for group rings of additive groups.
If $a+b=c$ in an additive group, then
we write $x^ax^b=x^{a+b}=x^c$ in the group ring.

\begin{exercise}
Prove that $\mathbb{Z}G$ is commutative if and only $G$ is abelian.
\end{exercise}

It is useful to write the coefficients of the product as a formula of
the multiplicands.  Specifically, if
\[
\left( \sum_{g \in G} a_g g \right) \cdot
\left( \sum_{g \in G} b_g g \right)
= \sum_{g \in G} c_g g
\]
then
\[
c_g = \sum_{h \in G} a_hb_{h^{-1}g}
\]
for every $g \in G$.

Another description of $\mathbb{Z}G$ is as the set
$\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathrm{Set}}(G,\mathbb{Z})$
of functions from $G$ to $\mathbb{Z}$.
However, the ring structure is \emph{not} the ``obvious one.''
The additive structure is indeed pointwise addition,
but we use the \emph{convolution product}
of two functions $f_1,f_2$ defined via
\[
(f_1 \ast f_2)(g) = \sum_{ij=g} f_1(i)f_2(j)
\]
for $g \in G$ and the indices in the sum $i,j$
vary over all pairs of elements of $G$ such that $ij=g$.
The isomorphism with $\mathbb{Z}G$ is by identifying each basis element
$g \in \mathbb{Z}G$ with the characteristic function $\chi_g$
in $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathrm{Set}}(G,\mathbb{Z})$
satisfying $\chi_g(h) = \delta_{gh}$ for all $h \in G$.

\subsection{Modules of the group ring}

The relevance of the group ring to group theory is evident from the
following proposition:

\begin{proposition} \label{prop:equivalence}
Let $G$ be a finite group and $k$ a field.
The structure of a representation of $G$ over the field $k$
is equivalent to the structure of a left $kG$-module.
Finite-dimensional representations correspond to
finitely generated modules.
Moreover, $G$-equivariant linear transformations are
exactly the $kG$-module homomorphisms.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:equivalence}]
Let $M$ be a left $kG$-module.
In particular, $M$ is a $k$-vector space.
We construct a linear representation $\rho : G \to \operatorname{GL}(M)$
via $\rho_g(m)=gm$ for $g \in G$ and $m\in M$.
Conversely, given a linear representation $\sigma : G \to
\operatorname{GL}(V)$, we endow $V$ with a $kG$-module structure via
\[
\left( \sum_{g \in G} a_g g \right) v := \sum_{g \in G} a_g \sigma_g(v)
\]
for $\{a_g\}$ from $k$ and $v \in V$.
These are mutually inverse operations.

If $M$ is a finitely-generated left $kG$-module,
say by $\{s_1,\ldots,s_n\}$, then $M$ is spanned as a $k$-vector space
by $\{ gs_i \mid g \in G, 1 \le i \le n \}$.
Thus $\rho$ is a finite-dimensional representation.
Conversely, if $V$ is finite-dimensional, then a basis for $V$
as a $k$-vector space is a fortiori a generating set for $V$ as a
$kG$-module.

Finally, we observe that a $G$-equivariant linear transformation
$f : (V,\rho) \to (W,\sigma)$ of representations are exactly the $kG$-module
homomorphisms under the above correspondence.
Indeed,
\begin{align*}
&f\left( \left( \sum_{g\in G} c_g g \right) v \right)\\
=& f\left( \sum_{g\in G} c_g \rho_g(v) \right)\\
=& \sum_{g\in G} c_g f\left( \rho_g(v) \right)\\
=& \sum_{g\in G} c_g \sigma_g\left(f(v)\right)\\
=& \left(\sum_{g\in G} c_g g\right) f(v)
\end{align*}
where we used the fact that $f$ is linear and $G$-equivariant.
\end{proof}

Immediately, we see that subrepresentations correspond to submodules,
quotient representations correspond to quotient modules, and direct sums
correspond to direct sums.
However, while $V \otimes_k W$ and $\operatorname{Hom}_k(V,W)$ have
induced $kG$-module structures, they are \emph{not} the same as the
module-theoretic constructions $V \otimes_{kG} W$
and $\operatorname{Hom}_{kG}(V,W)$ discussed below.
Moreover, the ``trivial module'' is the zero representation,
\emph{not} the ``trivial representation''.

\begin{example}
Every ring is a module under itself.
The group algebra $kG$ viewed as a $kG$-module is just the regular
representation of $G$.
\end{example}

Another important subtlety in the above is that the dimension of a
representation is \emph{not} in general the same as the minimal number
of generators of the corresponding $kG$-module.

\begin{definition}
Let $R$ be a ring and $M$ an $R$-module.
We say $M$ is \emph{simple} if $M\ne 0$ has no submodules except for
$0$ and $M$ itself.
We say $M$ is \emph{indecomposable} if $M$ cannot be written as a direct sum of
non-zero submodules.
We say $M$ is \emph{semisimple} if $M$ is a direct sum of simple
submodules.
\end{definition}

A $kG$-module is indecomposable if it is indecomposable as a
representation.
A $kG$-module is simple if and only if it is irreducible
as a representation of $G$.
In particular, irreducible representations can be
generated by one element as a $kG$-module (though the converse may not
be true).

\begin{theorem}[Maschke's Theorem restated]
If $G$ is finite of order coprime to the characteristic of a field $k$,
then every finitely-generated $kG$-module is semisimple.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Center of the Group Ring}

The center of a group ring is of special importance.

\begin{definition}
Let $R$ be a ring.
The \emph{center} of $R$ is the subset
\[
Z(R) := \{ z \in R \mid rz=zr \textrm{ for all } r \in R \},
\]
which is a commutative subring of $R$.
\end{definition}

Note that we also have the notion of the center $Z(G)$ of a group $G$.
Indeed, the group ring of the center of a group is contained in the
center of the group ring; in other words
\[
kZ(G) \subseteq Z(kG).
\]
However, equality holds only when $G=Z(G)$, which is a consequence of the
following result.

\begin{proposition}
The center $Z(kG)$ of the group algebra $kG$ has basis
\[
\left\{
\sum_{g \in K} g\ \middle|\ K \in \mathcal{K}
\right\}
\]
where $\mathcal{K}$ is the set of conjugacy classes of a finite group.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let $K$ be a conjugacy class in $\mathcal{K}$.
Note that $g \in K$ implies
$hgh^{-1} \in K$.
Thus we observe that
\[
h\left(\sum_{g \in K} g\right)
=\left(\sum_{g \in K} g\right) h
\]
for all $h \in H$. 
Conversely, any element $x$ of the group algebra
satisfying the property $hx=xh$ must have the same coefficient
on basis elements belonging to the same conjugacy class.
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
Suppose $G=D_6=\langle s,r \mid s^2, r^3, (sr)^2 \rangle$
is the dihedral group of order $6$.
We determine that
$Z(\mathbb{Z}G)$ has basis
\[
\{ 1, a = s+sr+sr^2, b = r+r^2 \}.
\]
The multiplication table is determined by a few calculations:
\begin{align*}
a^2 &= 3+3b\\
ab=ba &= 2a\\
b^2 &=2+b.
\end{align*}
Thus, the structure of the center is a bit obscure in this basis.
\end{example}

When $k=\mathbb{C}$ the center is especially easy to describe.
We will see in the next section that $Z(\mathbb{C}G) \cong \mathbb{C}^{|K|}$
as $\mathbb{C}$-algebras.  However, this is not at all obvious in the
basis described above.

\subsection{Decomposition of the Complex Group Algebra}

Let $G$ be a finite group.
Let $W_1,\ldots,W_r$ be the distinct
complex irreducible representations of $G$
and let $n_1,\ldots, n_r$ be their dimensions.

\begin{theorem}
There is a canonical isomorphism
\[
\mathbb{C}G \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^r \operatorname{End}_{\mathbb{C}}(W_i)
\]
of $\mathbb{C}$-algebras.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
If $V$ is a $kG$-module and $x$ is an element of $kG$,
then the multiplication map $v \mapsto xv$ is an endomorphism
of $V$.
This gives a map from $\mathbb{C}G$ to each
$\operatorname{End}_C(W_i)$ and we obtain
a map to the direct sum.
The map is injective since the action on the regular representation
is faithful.
Since both algebras have dimension $n_1^2+\cdots+n_r^2$,
this must be an isomorphism.
\end{proof}

Note that for any complex vector space $V$ of dimension $n$, we have
a (non-canonical) isomorphism
$\operatorname{End}(V) \cong \operatorname{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$.
Thus, we can rewrite the theorem above as:  

\begin{corollary} \label{cor:fourier_as_matrices}
$\displaystyle
\mathbb{C}G \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^r \operatorname{M}_{n_i}(\mathbb{C})$
\end{corollary}

Recall that the center of a matrix algebra
$\operatorname{M}_n(\mathbb{C})$ is just the subalgebra of scalar
matrices, which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$.
In view of Corollary~\ref{cor:fourier_as_matrices},
we have
\[
Z(\mathbb{C}G) \cong Z\left( \bigoplus_{i=1}^r \operatorname{M}_{n_i}(\mathbb{C}) \right)
\cong \mathbb{C}^r,
\]
which is an isomorphism of $\mathbb{C}$-algebras.

Thus we have two bases of $Z(\mathbb{C}G)$: one indexed by conjugacy
classes and one indexed by irreducible representations.
The character table of $G$ is exactly the change of basis matrix between
these two bases.

\begin{example}
Let $G = \mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ be the cyclic group of order $3$.
Note $kG \cong k[x]/(x^3-1)$ for any field $k$.
We fine that $\mathbb{R}G \cong \mathbb{R} \oplus \mathbb{C}$,
so the corollary is more subtle over non-closed fields.
Moreover, the element $x-1$ in $\mathbb{F}_3G$ is nilpotent,
so things are potentially much worse when Maschke's theorem does not
hold.
\end{example}

\subsection{Idempotents}

Earlier in the course, we have seen several examples of projections in
$\operatorname{End}_k^G(V)$ for various representations $(V,\rho)$.
For example, the projection $\pi : V \to V^G$ onto the invariant
subspace has the formula
\[
\pi(v) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \rho_g(v)
\]
for $v \in V$.
Other examples include the Young projectors, Young symmetrizers,
and the projections onto isotypic components.
These are all more naturally considered as coming from elements
of the group algebra.

Given a representation $\rho : G \to \operatorname{GL}(V)$
and an element
\[
f = \sum_{g \in G} c_g g
\]
in the group algebra $kG$,
define $\widehat{f}(\rho) \in \operatorname{End}(V)$ via
\[
\widehat{f}(\rho)(v) = \sum_{g \in G} c_g \rho_g(v)
\]
for all $v \in V$.
Thus, the projection $\pi$ above is simply the endomorphism
$\widehat{f}(\rho)$
where $f = |G|^{-1} \sum_{g \in G} g$.
In practice, we will simply write $f$ instead of $\widehat{f}(\rho)$
since there is rarely danger of confusion.

\begin{definition}
Let $R$ be a ring.  An element $e$ is an \emph{idempotent} if $e^2=e$.
Two idempotents $e_1,e_2$ are \emph{orthogonal} if $e_1e_2=e_2e_1=0$.
An idempotent $e$ is \emph{central} if $e$ is contained in the center
$Z(R)$ of $R$.
A \emph{primitive idempotent} is a non-zero idempotent
that is not a sum of two non-zero orthogonal idempotents.
A \emph{primitive central idempotent} is a non-zero central idempotent
that is not a sum of two non-zero orthogonal central idempotents.
\end{definition}

Warning: a primitive central idempotent is often not a central primitive
idempotent!  Sometimes the term ``centrally primitive'' is used
instead of ``primitive central,'' which is either more or less confusing
depending on which side you rolled out of the bed in the morning.

\begin{example}
Consider the matrix algebra $\operatorname{M}_2(\mathbb{C})$
and set
\[
a = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix},
b = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix},
c = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix},
\textrm{ and }
d = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{2} & -\frac{1}{2} \\ -\frac{1}{2} &
\frac{1}{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Each of $a,b,c,d$ are primitive idempotents, but none are central.
We see that $a,b$ are orthogonal and $c,d$ are orthogonal.
The identity matrix $1$ is the unique non-zero central idempotent,
but it is not a primitive idempotent since $a+b=1$ or $c+d=1$.
However, the identity $1$ is a primitive central idempotent.
\end{example}

We will see later that idempotents are a useful module theoretic
language for understanding decompositions of representations.
First, observe that if $p \in kG$ is an idempotent,
then $\widehat{p}(\rho)$ is a projection for any representation $\rho$.
(The converse is not true, consider the direct sum of two copies the regular
representation and the projection onto a summand.)
Second, if $p$ is a primitive idempotent, then the corresponding
projection $\pi$ on the regular representation has image an
indecomposable subrepresentation.

For the complex group ring, we can even say more.
From the isomorphism
\[
\mathbb{C}G \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^r \operatorname{End}(W_i)
\]
we see that the central idempotents of $\mathbb{C}G$
are the possible sums of the identities of each
$\operatorname{End}(W_i)$.
In particular, the primitive central idempotents correspond
to the projections on the isotypic components.
